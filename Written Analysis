From the Main.ipynb data, there are serveral conclusions to arrive to:
1. Schools having better performance (determined by % Overall) is not related to their budget or to how much they spends on each student. In fact, it seems to have a negative trend. We see this as the bottom 
  5 performing schools have, on average, a bigger budget and a bigger per student budget over the top 5 performing schools. 
2. Math and reading scores remain stagnant between the grades. There is a lack of improvement as grades continue but there is also no decrease of skills neither.
3. Large schools tend to have lower overall passing percentages. A increase of students seems to be a bigger strain on school systems and resources. A larger student to teacher ratio. Research shows that smaller classrooms
  leads to better performances from the students.
4. Charter Schools perform better than district schools on average. Most likely due to management differences of the school types. Charter schools are public schools of choice which means that charter schools are more
  dependent on their test scores to drive in business. A direct dependacy could be the source of the higher performances on average.
